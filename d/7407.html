    I went to the office and enquired upon the forecoming semester break. Good part is that you'd have to only pay the re-admission charges in excess of the Re-registration fees' for the specific subjects..
  <p>
    Also, N+3 rule stays on, making it possible to come back here once im all set / have my entire set.
  <p>
    This lso reflects upon the pain that I'm goin g to cause to my parents as well as my own self, for this would be a turning point inh all of our lives. 
    <p><strong>
     The thing is that I've come way too far from what they'all expected of me, and now I just can't give it all up, that too in this manner.</strong>
      <p>
        The problem is me, "The me in me", that wont allow me to fade away in the echoes that finally lose all its energon. I have done so much, so long, built me up, from nothing to eveerything that I am today at <b><i>d/7407</i></b>. This wont be the first time I'd have to start from ground up, from nothing, to again gain my "everything". All these times my sensitiveness succumbs to its nullifying fate, and everytime I promise me to never let that happen again. But yet, it always burns down to ashes. Ashes to which I could only add tears. 
        <p>
          Being agile, a little different, un-oppressed, costs me my values every single fucking time. And now you'd prolly say you're being too selfish not to think about all the people that are depndent on you. Lol fuck NO. They're all smart, witty people. They'd sure find their own calling(s)
          <p>And if they do Not, then I'd heartily bear the burden of letting y'all down, assume me self guilty for your suffering.
            Again, No I'm not at all high rn, nor have been in the past 6-7 weeks i believe.
            <p>
              This wrath is taking over me, and its reckless in its beckoning.
              <b>May I seek what I always deserved</b>
