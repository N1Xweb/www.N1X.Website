<h3>D-7419 : T+1107</h3>
<p>A  very difficult daybreak did us part. Again. Once again i was standing there. Gasping at thine gloomy art. For whatever i had done, i has won, didn't, just couldn't help me ease the pain in my heart <br>
 <br>
 It didn't help that I had my genius on my side. Just kept falling so fucking helpless. Self pity drenched my conscience. All this money and yet I couldn't bring that glee. The happy days were just such deceiving . 
  <br> 
 I didn't even take her to the uni, not did i show her the workshop. All this gladiatoria, all fell host to my selfishness.
 <br> 
 But I guess this wasn't the end, the end i forever despise.
 For the day will rise again, the nights will fall, and thine Aspirations dissolve.
 <p>
 teary eyed
